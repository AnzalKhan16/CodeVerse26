## 🗄️ Database Schema & Architecture

The database is powered by high-performance SQLite (`data/codeverse.db`) in WAL mode with foreign key enforcement:

* **`teams`**: Stores team ID, unique registration ID (`CV26-TM-XXXXX`), team name, track, project title, member count, and status.
* **`team_members`**: Foreign key to `teams(id)`. Stores full name, registration number, college email, phone number, and leader flag.
* **`payments`**: 1-to-1 foreign key to `teams(id)`. Stores payment method, UTR number, transaction date, amount, uploaded proof path, status, and admin notes.
